# Counter App

A simple Flutter Counter app that lets users increment, decrement, and reset a counter. The app also displays a Snackbar message when the counter exceeds 10 clicks.

## Features
- âž• **Increment Counter**: Increases the counter by 1 when the "Add" button is pressed.
- âž– **Decrement Counter**: Decreases the counter by 1 when the "Remove" button is pressed (only if the counter is greater than 0).
- ðŸ”„ **Reset Counter**: Resets the counter to 0 when the "Reset" button is pressed.
- ðŸŽ‰ **Snackbar Notification**: Displays a Snackbar with a message when the counter exceeds 10 clicks.
